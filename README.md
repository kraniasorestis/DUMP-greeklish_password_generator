This is a personalised greeklish dictionary creator, desingned for penetration 
testing within Greece - but it can obviously be altered for use in other languages. 
It's being developed to fill a gap in dictionary-attacks in Greece
which fail too often precisely because there is no good greeklish 
dictionary similar to rockyou and because tools like cupp do not
help that much when it comes to Greek.

The premise: if you provide this program with info on your target
it will generate a wordlist (implementing a 'cupp-like thinking') 
taylored specifically for your target, with greater chances of success 
than a usual english dictionary, which is next to useless in Greece. 

I didn't have the time to do any type checking to the input you give, so,
if you type words where you should be typing telephone numbers etc,
the crappy passwords that will be generated will be on you!'
